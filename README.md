# poly
A library for easier polymorphism in C++
## Download
To use `poly`, only a single file is required - `poly.hpp`. You can also use it in conjunction with `poly_factory` by downloading `poly_factory.hpp`. All downloads are available [here](https://github.com/andreasxp/poly/releases).
## Compiler requirements
To use `keyed_set`, your compiler must be up to ISO C++14 standard. In particular, it must support `constexpr`.
## How to use
Include header:
```c++
#include "poly.hpp"
using zhukov::poly; //For convenience
```
